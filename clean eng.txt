As you can see, the patient's brain is more developed than the normal brain. no audio
Therefore, he is suffering from even the smallest sound. no audio
There's also a very sensitive area that controls emotions. no audio
We have got some results here from the tests that have already come in. no audio
We still got some more tests to do. no audio
Now, there might be a small chance of complications, but I realize that... no audio
To relieve his pain, the only solution is to perform partial lobotomy. no audio
As a post-surgical after effect, he may suffer from extreme pain or may not feel any emotions at all. no audio
Si-mok, do your ears hurt even after the brain surgery?
No.
Have you felt angry or upset recently?
No.
Then, what about feeling happy or laughing out loud?
No.
What kind of food do you crave the most these days?
What do you like?
I don't like anything.
How was it before?
Did you not have any likes or dislikes even back then?
What was it like before the surgery?
Were things very different compared to now?
Si-mok is hardly able to feel any emotions.
We'll have to keep monitoring his progress, but there may be occurrences of other post-surgery side effects.
-What are you doing?
-Hurry up and move the car!
I'm Moo-sung Park.
It's very nice to meet you.
SANGHWA CONSTRUCTION
CEO MOO-SUNG PARK
Just come over to my place.
There are things we have to discuss.
That is 75-4.
This is 74-5.
Here is 76.
Excuse me. Do you know where 75-3 is?
-Why are you following me?
-Mr. Park is home, right?
I don't know who that is.
You live there, 75-3.
No, it is not. Please leave.
Goodness, what a waste.
I brought them for Moo-sung.
I'm not a creditor.
What are you talking about?
Why would I be scared of creditors?
Your house will also get seized
in the near future.
Let's go.
You are really not here
because of money, right?
No one owes me any money.
In fact, I have a ton of debt myself too.
Did you go to school with Moo-sung?
No, I didn't.
My family had a party.
I thought all the food would be gone
if I waited until the end,
so I quickly brought a few things.
Moo-sung doesn't eat anything
when I'm not home.
This is it.
You are really not a creditor, right?
We now have no money whatsoever.
Goodness, he must be sleeping.
He hasn't been getting much sleep
at night these days.
Why is this open?
Please wait outside.
Moo-sung.
The knife brushed against his arm
and left a shallow wound on his side.
His neck. This is the fatal wound.
Three stab wounds.
Someone who is right-handed.
It must have been someone
who was holding grudges.
Was it a spur-of-the-moment thing?
Don't underestimate me. Your lives
are in my hands. Do you know that?
I have nothing to lose now.
Go tell the deputy chief prosecutor.
If I open my mouth, he might get
buried alive in a matter of seconds.
I will never die alone.
The killer used the knife that was here.
The fact that the culprit
came in here without a weapon...
I'm calling to report a murder incident.
It's 75-3 Saebit-ro, Huam-dong.
A forensic unit is required on the scene,
and the victim is dead.
There's an elderly woman in her 70s too,
so please send an ambulance as well.
Could you identify yourself?
HANGANG YONGSAN CABLE TV
MISSED CALL FROM 1660-8237
Hello, thank you for calling
Hangang Yongsan Cable TV...
This is 75-3 Huam-dong.
Did you get a repair request
from Moo-sung Park?
Are you Mr. Park?
What time is the technician
scheduled to arrive?
Just a second, please.
He was supposed to arrive
at 2 p.m. Is he not there yet?
I would like his name and address, please.
Sir, we will get in touch
with the technician and...
I'm a prosecutor
from Western Seoul Prosecutors' Office.
His name and address, please.
- Pardon me?
-He's a murder suspect.
I need his name and address.
Hold on, please.
His name is Jin-seob Kang.
His address is...
It is 61 Saechang-ro.
Please send a photo of him to this number.
Is he dead...
He is dead.
Guys,
-check around the house.
-Yes, sir.
Hello?
This is the police. Is anyone inside?
Hello?
Hello?
-You called, right? We are the police.
-Please take her.
-Okay.
-Okay.
There is a body in the living room.
There is a murder weapon as well.
-Sorry? Who are you?
-Ma'am, are you okay?
-I'm from the Prosecutors' Office.
-Ma'am!
-Where is the forensic unit?
-The Prosecutors' Office?
-Then, are you a prosecutor...
-Ma'am!
Ma'am. Are you all right?
Ma'am.
Excuse me.
Wait!
Excuse me.
Wait! Sir!
Sir, wait!
-He is from...
-What is the matter? Who is he?
He is a...
Just get him! Make sure you get him!
I said, stop right there.
Can't you hear me?
Hey!
Damn it.
Good. There you are. Then I'll just...
You jerk.
I won't let you get away like that.
Come in.
This is Mr. Park. He is a friend of mine.
I'm Moo-sung Park.
It is very nice to meet you,
Mr. Si-mok Hwang.
Yes, it's nice to meet you.
Have a seat.
I said great things about you to him,
so he has been dying to meet you.
Mr. Seo told me a lot about you.
I have to make a quick call.
I have been wanting
to meet you for a long time.
I see.
SANGHWA CONSTRUCTION
CEO MOO-SUNG PARK
I wanted to help a little
since you do a lot of important work.
I hope you are not uncomfortable.
It has no spending limit,
so please use it for good deeds.
Listen, 0474, please pull over.
JIN-SEOB KANG RESUME
Hey, 0474, pull over.
Get off.
I'm Prosecutor Hwang
from Western Seoul Prosecutors' Office.
Why would a prosecutor run away?
Name, Jin-seob Kang. He is the suspect.
How do you know?
Can you turn off the siren?
He will run away.
I'm asking how you know.
Are you the victim's family member?
Where are you heading to?
To 61 Saechang-ro.
Turn off the siren, please.
HANGANG YONGSAN CABLE TV
Damn it!
-Move.
-Hey!
-Get out of my way.
-Goodness!
Shit.
What the...
What the hell?
Get lost!
Shit!
Shit.
Damn it!
You little...
Article Three Section One
of the Police Powers and Duties Act.
You are under arrest
for obstruction of justice.
You have the right to an attorney,
and the right to remain silent.
You may also refuse to answer questions.
Is that it? That is everything
he sold you?
Yes, this is it.
By the way, I paid him.
What will happen to my money?
We will give it back to you later on.
Wait, where are you going?
Where are you going now?
Wait! Goodness.
When will you give me back my money...
Goodness, this guy.
Where is...
Hey!
This hurts.
YONGSAN POLICE STATION
Goodness.
You let him take the suspect?
I'm sorry, sir.
What can you do?
He's a prosecutor after all.
It is not an important case anyway.
You should have seen
the mess in that house.
I wonder how he found and stole them.
Did he spot them
when he was fixing their TV?
By the way, why did the prosecutor
happen to be there at that time?
I will go there now and find out, okay?
I need to see the suspect too.
-All right. Get going.
-Yes, sir.
Goodness, can someone take
some of my cases off my plate?
It is going to take forever
to work on all of these cases.
You lazy ass.
Hello?
The laptop?
Hey, I heard a prosecutor beat you.
Who dared to mess with you,
Lieutenant Han?
This jerk.
-I'm heading out to get back at him.
-Goodness.
Is he a prosecutor or a brutal criminal?
That drawing is a little...
Hey!
He said you should go
to the hospital first.
Did Chief say that?
Why? Did the victim's mother wake up?
Yes. Well...
I will go to the Prosecutors' Office.
No, it's okay. I will go.
It's all right. I will take care of it.
You joined our team two months ago,
yet he still calls you "hey."
Will his tongue split
if he addresses you respectfully?
Detective Jang,
I will be back soon.
My goodness. Please take
your time, Lieutenant Han.
-See you.
-See you. Good luck.
My goodness. Mr. Hwang, your face looks...
What happened? Did that jerk do it?
Are you okay?
We should have some ointment around.
I'm all right. Ms. Young, later.
-I need you in here.
-Sure.
You have been informed of your right
to remain silent.
I found them in the yard.
I didn't even go into the house.
Feet up, please.
Are we good now?
God, what are you doing now?
It is not me. I didn't do it!
Had you planned it in advance,
you would have prepared a weapon
and kept your shoes on as well.
You went there because of their TV,
and he happened to be home alone.
Then, you saw a knife within your reach.
You lost it momentarily, didn't you?
A spur-of-the-moment murder.
Goodness, no.
He was already dead when I got there.
I was about to run out of there
as I was so shocked. Then,
I saw necklaces and so on
right beside him.
I know I shouldn't have done it.
I must have been out of my mind.
But that is really all that happened.
I did not kill him.
How did you get into the house?
Someone let me in. Somebody opened
the door for me from inside.
-Who?
-How would I know?
He was already there when you got there,
and no one else was home.
That's what you told me a few seconds ago.
His son and mother
are his only family members.
His son is serving in the military now,
and his mother wasn't home.
He was home alone and was found dead.
Then, who opened the door for you?
Was it a ghost?
I rang the doorbell,
and someone let me in.
That person must be the killer.
Whoever that was inside.
Shouldn't you catch him?
You think a killer
would kindly let someone in
immediately after killing someone?
He obviously wanted to frame me
for what he did.
But you didn't go in.
You said you found them in the yard.
I only said that because I knew
you wouldn't trust me.
When an ex-convict purposely
picks a job that allows him
to visit people's homes...
Goodness, this is driving me nuts.
Do you think all ex-convicts
kill people for no reason?
The entire house was already a total mess
when I got there.
Please believe me!
What's this?
He is not caught off guard.
He is confused.
What is this?
He is not acting like he doesn't know.
He hasn't seen them before.
DEPUTY CHIEF PROSECUTOR
CHANG-JUN LEE
Is there a problem?
Moo-sung Park.
My apologies. I keep digging,
but I haven't...
He is dead.
Pardon me?
Mr. Park is dead.
When?
How?
Robbery murder.
Sorry?
The suspect is here now.
The suspect has already been caught?
Congratulations, sir.
Watch your mouth.
I'm sorry.
Don't you think
a robbery-murder case is perfect though?
Si-mok is the one who found the body first
and arrested the suspect.
-What a coincidence.
-It's certainly not a coincidence.
They must have been in league.
If he wasn't killed,
we would be getting prosecuted
by Si-mok instead of that suspect.
What if Mr. Park told him everything
before he died?
What is there to tell?
It is not like we asked him
for cars or houses like others do.
We just went out for a few meals
with him, that's all.
Dead men tell no tales.
And the most important piece
of the puzzle is gone.
No matter how capable Si-mok is,
he can't play this
without the one who holds the key.
You obviously don't know him well enough.
He is like a venomous snake.
He will use this case
in order to dig deeper.
Sir, let me handle this case. I will...
Let Eun-soo take care of it.
You mean the trainee in Si-mok's office?
She will turn it into a bigger deal.
It's about time she took on a real case.
Also, she will be a lot easier
to handle than Si-mok.
Keep a watchful eye
on how everything goes, please.
It's too obvious.
Si-mok will certainly sense
that we are trying to exclude him.
We have already made it obvious.
He might try to make us
give up our prosecutor's badges.
That's why I should take it on and...
Do you think Si-mok is an idiot?
Do you think he will leave
a mouse in a cat's hands?
Why am I a cat?
Don't you dare act like you don't know.
We both know
whom Mr. Park resented the most.
They were looking for someone
who wants a family-like work environment.
Ex-convicts need
to sustain themselves too.
I only did it to earn a living.
I should have been honest
about my criminal record,
but they said they would
treat me like family.
But family, my ass.
I don't even have time to take a piss,
let alone eat anything.
I even had to write an apology for getting
a low customer satisfaction rate.
They keep harassing me
if I take a little longer at one location.
I'm required to sell too.
I don't even have weekends off.
I have to work my ass off
on weekends as well.
Do you know how much they pay me a month
for working like a dog?
Why do you think I'm behind on my rent?
The fact that you are behind on rent
means you must have debts as well.
You sure have a motive.
Sir, I...
I really wanted to start afresh
and work hard, okay?
I'm a dad.
Sir, I...
I have a kid.
My wife. She is...
She's clueless even though she's a mom.
I have to look after my kid.
No one else would do it.
I'm telling you.
I really want to be a good dad.
I want my kid to grow
into a wonderful person.
I swear, I really wanted to start afresh.
Yes, I shouldn't have let my greed
get the best of me
even though I saw the dead body.
But I didn't do it.
I really didn't do it.
How can anyone with a heart kill someone?
Send him to the detention center.
Sir!
What are his charges?
We will fill it in later on.
I'm innocent!
I told you I didn't do it.
Why don't you believe me?
Innocent?
Even if your claim is true,
you saw the dead man covered in blood
and grabbed his money first.
Can you call that innocent?
Do you think anyone can do that?
I have stolen things,
but I would never kill anyone!
Goodness, I...
It wasn't me. I didn't do it.
I'm saying I didn't do it! No!
Sir, I really didn't do it!
It wasn't me!
I see.
Sure, okay.
Thank you. I will do my best.
Congratulations.
Goodness, suspects never admit
to what they did.
Not a single one of them.
Later on, all of them turn out
to be the culprits.
-Sir.
-Yes.
Ms. Young's probation is over as of today.
Has it already been six months?
Goodness, time does fly.
Congratulations.
Prosecutor Young.
It's thanks to all of you.
Request a DNA analysis
and register it as evidence.
I guess this will be the last time.
Call them and get the suspect's
social security number.
Please track his bank accounts.
The last time?
She's been appointed as a prosecutor
for a criminal trial.
Really?
Congratulations.
The first case is very important.
What did you get?
I have been told not to worry
about economic or political offenders
and start with the criminal cases
that came in today.
What? Then you will start with that guy
who was just here.
Shall I write a report first?
No, you can't.
Pardon?
Do not touch that case.
-I'm stepping out.
-Okay.
Mr. Hwang.
Mr. Hwang, why can't I work on it?
You just can't.
Don't you trust me?
No.
What's wrong? Is it because
of the murder from earlier today?
I heard a man named
Moo-sung Park or whatever died.
I have told you before.
You ended up with the fussiest mentor.
He's so greedy too.
He won't let you handle the case, right?
I actually haven't heard anything
about the case yet.
I guess it's a murder case.
Let's have some tea. Come to my office.
Prosecutor Hwang.
We meet again. I'm Su-chan Kim
from Yongsan Police Station.
-Hello.
-Just a second.
You did that earlier too.
I won't let you do it twice.
Are you here to see me?
Yes. We, police officers, have to write
reports too, you know. So...
Please go on.
You chased him.
How did you know he would be a suspect?
I saw a technician, who was supposed to
repair the victim's TV,
running away near the scene.
Then,
how did you know that he was supposed
to come to fix the victim's TV?
I saw that the victim,
an unemployed man in his 50s,
was reading a book he found in his son's
room and thought he must have been bored.
I tried turning on the TV just in case,
and it wasn't working.
Then why did you go there to begin with?
I personally know the victim.
What's your relationship
with the victim, Mr. Moo-sung Park?
I said I know him personally.
What was your first impression
of him like?
Pardon me? His first impression?
He's dead. Why do you ask?
You can call me
if you have additional questions.
-Will you charge the suspect?
-I should.
Sure, you should.
The issue is what he will be charged with.
No. He was already dead when I got there.
Who is it?
You piece of...
You stay right there.
What do you think you are doing? You jerk.
Thank you for cooperating
with my investigation.
I haven't gone out,
so it's been here the whole time,
but it will just have images
of the street.
-You won't find anything.
-I see. Thank you.
It will cost me quite a bit
to buy a new one.
I will give it back right away.
Just a minute, please.
The memory card...
My memory card!
Give me back my memory card!
That son of...
Damn it.
Great job today.
Great job.
PROSECUTOR SI-MOK HWANG
CASE REPORT ON MOO-SUNG PARK MURDER
We received a police report
on the case, so I took a peek at...
I apologize.
Will you be able to do it?
Yes, please entrust me with it.
How are you going to win?
Will I have to attend
the trial myself as well?
Of course, you will have to.
Is that even a question?
The evidence is very clear.
The stolen jewelry pieces have been
confirmed to be the victim's mother's.
The bloodstain on the sock
also matches the suspect's DNA profile.
Any fingerprints on the weapon?
We have only found
his mother's fingerprints.
The suspect, Jin-seob Kang, is insisting
that he didn't kill the victim.
He said he arrived on the scene after
the murder and just stole the jewelry.
He actually received a repair request
from the victim.
It obviously doesn't look
like it was premeditated.
How will you refute his claim?
Even if he received a repair request,
the fact that he broke
into the victim's house must mean
that he had an intention
of committing a crime.
Who says he broke in?
According to the victim's mother,
the victim was alone
on the scene at the time.
They always kept the door locked
because of creditors.
How else do you think he got in?
He insists that the real killer
must have let him in on purpose
to frame him for the murder.
That's complete nonsense.
Will you say that
in front of the presiding judge?
Can you please not do that
with your tongue?
I'm sorry.
Can you think of a counterclaim
that can refute everything at one blow?
Conclusive evidence
we can use to prove that the victim
was alive at that time.
Will something like that exist though?
It's not like they have security cameras
inside the house.
What's that?
Where did you get this?
This does show that he didn't
break into the house.
However, this can't serve as evidence
that the victim was still
alive at that time.
Why not?
The suspect's claim that the real killer
let him in on purpose
to dump everything on him
is certainly believable.
You said it's nonsense.
The suspect's attorney
will go on about it.
Right.
Have a look at this.
When you are used to being harassed
by creditors, the first thing you do
when you hear the doorbell is to peep out.
The suspect
is the killer, then.
COPYING FILES
PROCESSING
Mr. Hwang.
Yes, you should get going.
Why? I need it for the trial.
It's crucial evidence.
Tomorrow.
You have to give it to me tomorrow.
In 2 minutes and 35 seconds.
But I didn't do it.
I really didn't do it.
How can anyone with a heart kill someone?
I have stolen things,
but I would never kill anyone!
Yes, this is the criminal division
on the fourth floor.
This is Prosecutor Si-mok Hwang.
I will send a video clip to you now.
Please run an analysis on it.
The analysis must be completed by now.
It's the original file, right?
I heard you are prosecuting
the Huam-dong case.
It must be stressful
to debut with a homicide case.
I know for a fact
that I will win the trial.
What's that?
A key piece of evidence
that will get the suspect.
I just need to get it
on the evidence list.
Eun-soo.
It will be your one and only debut trial,
so you need to make it spectacular.
Shall I help you completely outdo
and beat his attorney?
The evidence list? Why would you want
to list something like this?
You owe me big time for this.
Hey, you should only go there
if you are struggling to catch the culprit
and want to try fishing for something.
- Do you want free food or what?
-Goodness.
It won't even take five minutes.
Yes, sir.
-Nearer, my God, to thee
-Nearer, my God, to thee
-Nearer to thee
-Nearer to thee
-Even though it be a cross
-Even though it be a cross
-That raises me
-That raises me
-Still all my song shall be
-Still all my song shall be
-Nearer, my God, to thee
-Nearer, my God, to thee
-Nearer, my God, to thee
-Nearer, my God, to thee
-Nearer to thee
-Nearer to thee
-Amen
-Amen
You don't have to get up.
Thank you.
This is my grandson.
I heard you are serving
in the military now.
It must be tough.
Yes.
Well, I should get going.
TODAY'S TRIALS, DEFENDANT JIN-SEOB KANG,
PROSECUTOR EUN-SOO YOUNG
TODAY'S TRIALS
COURTROOM 407
I went to the jewelry store
and collected evidence.
Then I confirmed that the jewelry pieces
the suspect stole...
WITNESS STAND
It indeed belonged to the victim's mother.
The fact that he stole something
doesn't mean he killed the victim, right?
But on the scene...
Please answer yes or no.
Does stealing something make you a killer?
-No.
-Thank you.
No more questions, Your Honor.
The witness may go back to her seat.
I think we will win.
COUNSEL
PROSECUTOR
-Who is he?
-I think he's a prosecutor.
Just remember what I said, okay?
Everything is there.
Your Honor, I would like to submit
this newly acquired piece of evidence.
We weren't notified of this in advance.
We just finished confirming its validity.
However, it's a very crucial piece
of evidence which will have
a profound effect on this case.
Both parties, please come forward.
Throughout the process of the trial,
the defendant has been denying
the charges, claiming that he arrived
on the scene after the murder.
Your Honor, please watch this video clip.
It's dashboard camera footage
we obtained last night from a vehicle
that was parked nearby.
Last night?
This shows the defendant arriving
on the scene on the day of the incident.
Yes, that is me.
While he's waiting for someone
to open the door
after pressing the doorbell...
Right here.
Please look here.
-What happened?
-What is that?
He was definitely killed.
As you can see here,
the victim was clearly alive
before the defendant entered the scene.
My goodness, he was alive indeed.
In order to check the possibility
of a third party's involvement,
we went through 12 hours of footage
prior to the estimated time
of the victim's death,
but the defendant
was the only one who was caught
on camera entering the scene.
We couldn't submit it in advance
as we were still checking it.
I apologize.
Defense counsel,
do you have anything to add?
No, no. Please.
-No, Your Honor.
-No. I didn't do it.
No, no! That's a total lie.
It's all fake. I didn't do it.
Please believe me!
-Please be quiet.
-I didn't do it.
I didn't kill him.
That must be fake. Why are you lying?
He was already dead when I got there!
I'm serious. Please believe me.
Your Honor, please tell them. Please.
Jung-eun, I didn't kill him.
I didn't do it!
I really didn't do it.
Why are you doing this to me?
I did not kill him.
I didn't kill him, Your Honor.
It wasn't me.
Why are you all doing this to me?
I did not kill him.
I really didn't kill him, Your Honor.
The defendant is denying clear evidence
and is not showing any interest
in reflecting on what he did.
Therefore, I hereby sentence
the defendant to 22 years in prison.
Ma'am, did you come alone?
Where is your grandson?
Why didn't you come with him?
I'm sorry. Excuse me for a second. Yes.
Yes, it's done.
Where? Another one?
No, it's okay. I will go. Sure.
Goodness.
By any chance...
Are you...
Yes, Si-mok Hwang. That's right, Si-mok.
It's so nice to run into you like this.
Hey, how long has it been?
About 20 years?
At the time, you suddenly...
Look at you. You have become a prosecutor.
Right, you used to get such good grades.
It looks like you work in this field too.
I just work as an office manager
at a small firm.
-Mr. Kim.
-My apologies.
I have to go.
I'm sorry. I will call you.
Let's catch up soon.
Hey, it was really nice running into you.
"Your Honor, I would like to submit
this newly acquired piece of evidence."
You were good.
I'm glad I listened to you
and brought it out at the end.
That's called a skill.
Storytelling is important even at trials.
What, when and how. How will you make
your arguments more impactful?
I will be sure to repay you for your help.
Mr. Hwang.
Are you not capable
of giving compliments or what?
Your mentee won her first case.
How dare he walk away when I'm talking?
Goodness, that piece of...
Mr. Seo helped me a lot
saying that the first trial
is very important.
I had such firm evidence,
so I only got a little bit
of advice from him.
You shouldn't learn those things first.
Isn't winning all that matters?
It's not like I fabricated the evidence,
and I won the case anyway.
Anyway.
Jin-seob!
-Jin-seob, my goodness...
-Honey, honey!
-Jin-seob, just a second.
-Jung-eun. Honey, honey!
-Wait, just a second.
-Min-jae, Min-jae!
Let go! Let go of me, please.
-Let him see his baby.
-Let go, please.
-Let him see his son just once.
-For just a second, please.
-Honey.
-Jin-seob, Jin-seob.
Honey. Min-jae.
Daddy is so sorry.
Daddy is so sorry.
Daddy is sorry for everything.
-Just a second, please.
-Daddy is so sorry. Just a second!
Honey, Min-jae.
-Honey, Min-jae!
-What should I do now?
-Min-jae!
-Jin-seob!
Jin-seob.
What should I do? What am I
supposed to do now, Jin-seob?
Jin-seob.
Jin-seob.
Jin-seob!
I miss him.
He must have been terrified.
It must have been so painful.
I should have stayed by his side.
I want to go with him.
I should have died with him.
Come with me, Si-mok.

Let's die together.
Mommy

Let's just...

I will never do that again, Mommy.
I can't do this anymore.

I'm sorry, Mommy.
Mommy.
Right.
Was that a friend of yours?
Yes, from middle school.

CASE REPORT ON MOO-SUNG PARK MURDER
They say that
the rich never go flat broke.
She has clearly been holding
onto her jewelry.
It will obviously tempt thieves.
Those were the only pieces she had left
after selling everything.
How heartbreaking.
Why did you go there that day?
Are you asking me that question just now?
Tell me.
The victim, Moo-sung Park,
used all of his connections
in order to avoid bankruptcy.
Soon enough, he realized
that his connections which he built
with money vanished along with his money.
He must have been convinced
that he'd be able to rise up again
if he could avoid embezzlement charges.
That arrogance is the reason he failed.
How dare he think of us prosecutors
as a safety net to fall back on?
Don't you think
he had a reason to think that?
What's your conclusion?
This is my conclusion.
A simple robbery murder
committed by a third party.
A third party.
It sounds like you think
there is a second party involved as well.
Something that could completely ruin
someone's life if he revealed it.
Go tell the deputy chief prosecutor.
If I open my mouth, he might get
buried alive in a matter of seconds.
Someone was being threatened.
Mr. Park,
who failed to reap what he sowed,
threatened someone that he would
disclose all the evidence of the bribes
and entertainment he had been providing.
Did you want to destroy that second party?
Is that why you joined hands
with Mr. Park?
To oust all of your corrupt colleagues?
I mean, you think you are the only one
with integrity.
What's rotten can be cut out.
But the same spot ends up rotting again
no matter how many times we cut it out.
I have been witnessing it every single day
for the last eight years.
No organization in this country
would be willing
to cut off its right arm with a knife
in its left hand.
Only those who were hopeful get hurt.
You are saying that's why Mr. Park died.
The person whom he was threatening
hired the ex-convict to kill him.
Si-mok, I'm disappointed.
You used to be pretty bright
back in the days.
Breaking a TV at someone's house
and finding a repair technician
who is an ex-convict.
That person isn't that clumsy.
Then what would that person do?
Jin-seob Kang's claim
that Mr. Park was already dead...
I thought it could be true.
The real killer could be someone else.
After killing Mr. Park,
the killer might have tried
to get rid of all the evidence.
He probably went through
every nook and cranny in the house,
so the jewelry might have naturally
ended up on the floor.
But the person who killed
that hypothesis is you.
Yes, that's correct.
Nicely done.
You sure are capable.
You must be upset.
Go get a soothing bowl
of soup for yourself.
Thank you.
Mr. Park told me himself.
That he joined hands with you.
He said you are ruthless and heartless,
so I'd better help him with his problem
before you do anything.
Si-mok,
don't get the wrong idea.
He didn't trust you.
He wanted to show me.
But you still asked me
why I went there that day.
Isn't it because you are curious
about how much I know?
The thing Mr. Park threatened you with.
The thing that can bury you alive
in a matter of seconds.
What that thing is
and whether I know it or not.
So?
I will go enjoy that bowl of soup.
Is this neighborhood cursed or what?
Goodness, poor thing.
It looks like it happened a while ago.
I feel so bad for Happy, but...
We thought Happy ran away from home, but
look at what happened.
Someone might have killed him
because he barked.
What if it was a thief's doing?
A thief?
Is anything missing?
Did anyone get hurt?
I'm not saying we had a thief.
A few months ago...
Do you see that house over there?
Someone died there.
Come to think of it,
I think Happy disappeared that day.
Hold on. Just a minute, please.
Goodness, what kind of scum did this?
This tiny dog couldn't possibly
have barked that loudly.
Goodness, we had no idea
and just assumed that he ran away.
My poor Happy.
So? Do you want to get it analyzed?
Just in case, you know.
I just want to make sure.
Give it to me. I'm on my way
to the National Forensic Service now.
It's okay. I will go.
I'm going there anyway,
but you can go if you want.
Well, all right.
Please take it to them.
Thank you.
PROSECUTOR SI-MOK HWANG
Yes, please locate Jin-seob Kang's
whereabouts immediately.
He cannot be left alone.
This is so unfair.
Being wrongly accused like this
is driving me crazy.
I did not kill him.
It's all a lie.
It's nothing but a big fraud.
I'm innocent.
No one else might know the truth,
but I do.
I did not kill anyone.
The prosecutor altered the evidence
and turned me into a murderer.
I shouted to the point
that my throat bled,
but no one even listened to me
because I have no power,
connections or money.
Why do I have to be locked up
for the rest of my life
for something I didn't even do?
Why does my son have
to become a murderer's child?
I can't even die in peace
because of my child who will be
belittled and bullied all his life.
That prosecutor who treated me
like a worthless animal.
Inmate 36085!
I would like to report that prosecutor
who disgraced and tortured me
through my death.
I plead my innocence through my death.
I...
I did not kill him.
STRANGER
You killed him. You killed Jin-seob!
What made him so convinced?
That wouldn't have been
captured if the angle was a little off.
Are you sure you don't want
to hear about what I've found out?
Now, it's your turn.
What have you found out?
The prosecutors fabricated
the evidence, right?
Anyhow, have you found anything yet?
I'll find her soon.
Please give me more time.
Do you now realize what you have done?
-Where did you find the bloodstain?
-Jin-seob Kang didn't even go there.
Someone else must've left
the bloodstain there.
-The culprit is someone else.
-Who are you?
